This project is a basic recipe website to practice the HTML knowledge acquired up to this point. The skills demonstrated are foundational web development skills, basic git knowledge, HTML (tags, lists, links, images, etc...), commit messages, and command line to create directories and files.
Edit: CSS is now added.
